## Security and Best Practices

Webhook security is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use HTTPS" icon="lock">
    Always configure webhook URLs with HTTPS for encrypted communication.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Signatures" icon="shield">
    Implement signature verification using the provided secret key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Failures" icon="alert-triangle">
    Implement retry logic and error handling for failed deliveries.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="danger">Never expose sensitive information in webhook payloads and always validate incoming requests.</Callout>

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="How do I verify webhook signatures?" default-open="false">
    Use the secret key from your webhook settings to compute and compare HMAC signatures.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="What happens if my webhook fails?" default-open="false">
    HeyFounder.in will retry failed webhooks up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
  </Expandable>
